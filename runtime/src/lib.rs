//! # POPI Pallet
//!
//! Proof of positive interaction. A collectivity that contributes to build something.
//! There are different kind of things that may be built, each thing will go through
//! a set of lavoration steps. A lavoration step is registered onchain through an interaction.
//! The interaction is another user that verifies positively that your work contributed to move
//! a thing from the lavoration step n to the n+1.
//!
//! Yeah I know you didn't understand what I'm talking about. Lets make a concrete example:
//! a software company, may be an ecommerce software company, the website is built following a
//! kanban or scrum agile process. Think at the board typical columns:
//!
//! NEW	 | TODO | IN PROGRESS | CODE REVIEW | QA | READY TO DEPLOY | DEPLOYED | QA PRODUCTION | DONE
//!        Task1
//! Task2
//!                              Task3
//! ....
//!
//! We have tasks, task can be of 3 different kinds:
//! 1. UI = design the UI of a functionality
//! 2. FRONTEND DEVELOP = i.e. coding in React.js
//! 3. SERVER DEVELOP = i.e. implementing an API service consumed by the frontend
//! 4. BI = someone who analyses the user journey
//! 5. QA = Someone who validates something built
//! 6. PO = creator of tasks.
//! 7. PM = project manager
//!
//! Every task must follow all the steps from NEW to DONE. The progress can never be done by the
//! same person who worked on this specific task in this specific column.
//!
//! Lets make an example:
//! Task: change a color of a text "Click here to signin" from RED To Yellow.
//!
//! This task is created by UI. The task goes inmediately to the NEW column.
//! PO moves this to TODO.
//!
//! A developer PULLS this task, means: moves this task from TODO into IN PROGRESS>
//! Once she is done, set the task into "COMPLETED the current step". So small detail:
//! yes, someone else must move the task, but the person in this step must say "MY WORK IS READY TO
//! BE PULLED" So the board is simplified but actually it has the double of steps:
//! NEW| READY TO BE PULLED TO TODO | TODO| READY FOR INPROGRESS | INPROGRESS | READY FOR REVIEW |
//! REVIEW |
//!
//! three cases connected to the previous example:
//! 1. UI creates the task, this task must be well described, contain the color code corresponding
//!    to
//! Yellow. When she thinks the task is ready to be pulled by A PO, set the task as "READY TO BE
//! PULLED"
//!
//! 2. When a frontend developer takes a task from TODO to INPROGRESS. works on it, once she thinks
//!    everything is
//! completed and perhaps created a code review, sets this task as ready to be pulled
//!
//! 3. another developer will see the task as ready to be pulled and move it to Code review,
//! and so on.
//!
//! This Pallet is about the experience a person earns for working on something. We tried to figure
//! out the must fair way to earn experience, thinking also on how to resist to attacks by
//! introducing a few constraints:
//!
//! I already mentioned the first constraint, the most important: we work on a specific phase of a
//! task, set this as ready, but only another person may pull this task. Not anyone is capable of
//! pulling a task, but depending of the column, only an expert on that role may pull that task.
//! What makes you expert on something? We're talking about roles, roles are not preset. Like a QA
//! says " I am QA" or a root whitelist the user as QA. Tha'ts not what we want. Any person may work
//! on any kind of task, once someone else approves your task, we're setting a milestone. Someone is
//! saying "this person did a good job for this specific task in this specific phase". I'm setting a
//! STAMP. This stamp, makes the person which work on this task earn some experience points.
//!
//! That will be our ranking, and considering we may work on different kind of tasks, and our stamps
//! are given by different roles, we want to have a good granurality level keeping track of all
//! those aspects in a multidimensional matrix:
//!
//!  person given stamps by role | role1 | role 2 | role 3 | role 4
//! worked on kind of task:
//! kind 1
//! kind 2
//! kind 3
//! kind 4
//!
//! so for example, think on someone who is a bit QA, a bit developer.
//!
//! Alice worked on two tasks:
//! 1. as deveopler signup text color, changing from yellow to green.
//! 2. QA of a shopping cart functionality.
//!
//! Alice work on task 1, pull the task from TODO to INPROGRESS, once done set the task as ready for
//! review. A frontend expert pulls the task and move it to "Code review", finally approves that
//! task. Alice  work on task 2, pulling a task from CODE REVIEW DONE to QA, once done set QA to "QA
//! DONE"
//!
//! Many roles are involved in this process:
//! a. Task 1 pulled from TODO, was set as ready by a PO. Once Alice pulls it, is creating a proof
//! of positive interaction to the PO. Actually thinking on it, the proof is given just once Alice
//! finalize her task, and set it as READY to be pulled. cause the task creatd by the PO could have
//! low quality, not contain all the info needed and Alice never being able to finalize it. The next
//! role will make this point clearer: b. she sets the task as READY to be reviewed, cretes a code
//! review.A developer pulls it by movindg the task to CODE REVIEW, and the task could be low
//! quality, or not meet the espectations of the task. Only when the task will have an approved code
//! review, so the actual code review approval, will register a proof of positive interaction to
//! ALICE. c. once the code review is set as READY to be pulled, a QA will pull this task, work on
//! it, once the QA is ready, will set as QA done. Again, setting a positive proof of interaction
//! with the developer. d. a QA ready task, could be pulled perhaps by a PO(Product owner) or even
//! by a developer and moved to "READY TO BE RELEASED" e. when the task is deployed by a release
//! engineer or a developer, or a devops, this will increase the ranking of the PO.
//!
//! I hope now it is clear when I say that a person don't decides her role. Her role is an
//! experience depending on positive proof of interactiosn with other experts. Of course initially
//! in the project there will be no experts. Perhaps a ROOT could define initial roles, but I like
//! more the idea of initially every person has 0 as experience, and is allowed to approve
//! everything. We could define a formula that takes the norm of the experience on each role and
//! sets this as a minimum for approving a task. In this way the experience needed to approve will
//! be variable and grow with the overall experience of the community.
//!
//! Root(which could be for a specific project the PO), defines for a project two sets of values:
//! 1. kind of work(or in the board example, kind of tasks, for example a coding task,
//! 2. steps needed for a any work to be considered it DONE. In the board example, the columns of
//!    the board.
//! 3. The roles allowed to set a proof of positive interaction on some specific steps.
//! For example in our board example, only a PO is allowed to move a task from NEW to TO DO
//! Only a developer is allowed to allowed to pull and approve a code review. Or only a developer is
//! allowed to deploy the task.
//!
//! As I said before, what defines the a person to be a developer, is based on her experience, that
//! must be higher than the norm of all accounts in that specific role
